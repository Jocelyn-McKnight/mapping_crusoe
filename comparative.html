          <h1>Comparative map of Robinson Crusoe and its inspirations</h1>
          <p>
            This is a map of the possible inspirations for Robinson Crusoe. There are four texts layed against Robinson
            Crusoe (purple). An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon (Green), A New Voyage Round the World (Blue)
            A Cruising Voyage round the World (red), The Man in the Moone (yellow).

              A code identified all the locations in each of the texts given. It then put cooridinates onto a map and assigned
              them a colour based on the text it was coming from. This is the end result with all the coordinates from all the
              texts layed on top of one another.

            <h2>Reading the comparative map</h2>
            <p>
              By Strict;y considering the data in front of us (for a discussion on all the things that went wrong with the data,
              please see the mapping section) there are a few conclusions we can draw. First we can see that there is no perfect
              text that matches the trajectory of Robinson Crusoe. There are parts that line up quite nicely. For example Ceylon
              and Crusoe visit similar places in Western Africa, and A New voyage and Cruso visit similar places in South America.
              All of the texts have heavy action in Europe, and this is logical as Europe was a starting or ending point for many 
              of the voyages, as they were colonial.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might start by looking for overlaps: ports, islands, or
              regions that appear in multiple works. Then notice what is missing
              or displaced—places that Crusoe alludes to indirectly, or routes
              that are altered, simplified, or exaggerated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The map is not meant as a definitive reconstruction of any single
              journey, but as a way of seeing how these texts share a common
              geography while also reworking it. As you move between the map and
              the <a href="collections.html">individual collections</a>, think
              about how changes in setting also reshape genre, character, and
              narrative emphasis.
