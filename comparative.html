            This map brings together locations from all nine books in the
            exhibit. It visualizes how <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> and its potential
            sources cluster in particular regions, routes, and coastlines.

              The comparative map overlays routes and places from all nine
              collections, highlighting shared ports, overlapping sea routes,
              and areas that are unique to a single text.

            <h2>Reading the comparative map</h2>
            <p>
              Use this map to compare how different texts in the exhibit imagine
              travel, distance, and isolation. Some books cluster along
              well-established imperial and commercial routes, while others push
              outward toward more speculative or ambiguous locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might start by looking for overlaps: ports, islands, or
              regions that appear in multiple works. Then notice what is missing
              or displaced—places that Crusoe alludes to indirectly, or routes
              that are altered, simplified, or exaggerated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The map is not meant as a definitive reconstruction of any single
              journey, but as a way of seeing how these texts share a common
              geography while also reworking it. As you move between the map and
              the <a href="collections.html">individual collections</a>, think
              about how changes in setting also reshape genre, character, and
              narrative emphasis.
