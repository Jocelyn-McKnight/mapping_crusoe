          <h1>Comparative Map of Robinson Crusoe and its Inspirations</h1>
          <p>
            This is a map of the possible inspirations for Robinson Crusoe. There are four texts layed against Robinson
            Crusoe (purple). An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon (Green), A New Voyage Round the World (Blue),
            A Cruising Voyage round the World (red), The Man in the Moone (yellow).

              you see here shows all of the coordinates from all the texts layered on top of one another.

            <h2>Reading the comparative map</h2>
            <p>
              By strictly considering the data in front of us (for a discussion of everything that 
              went wrong with the data, please see the mapping section), there are a few conclusions we can draw. 
              First, we can see that there is no single text that perfectly matches the trajectory of <em>Robinson 
               Crusoe</em>, but this was never something that was expected. There are parts that line up quite nicely. 
              For example, <em>An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon</em> and <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> visit similar 
              places in West Africa, and <em>A New Voyage Round the World</em> and <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> visit similar 
              places in South America. All  of the texts have heavy activity in Europe, which is logical, as Europe was 
              a starting or ending point for many of these voyages, given their colonial context. In fact, the activity 
              across Europe is so heavy that it raises the question of whether mapping is a useful methodology for the 
              research question I have been trying to answer. No meaningful conclusions can be drawn from this portion 
              of the map, especially when one considers that specificity was a key concern going into this project. Could 
              other texts that came before <em>Crusoe</em> also have left from Hull or visited the same points in West Africa? 
              We cannot know with this map, as it is too noisy.

            <p>
              The comparison between <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> and <em>The Man in the Moone</em> yields interesting results. 
              They have a similar number of locations, and those locations are distributed similarly. We see heavy
              activity in Europe and lighter activity in Africa and South America. Both have significant activity in 
              North America; however, we know that this is not the most accurate set of data. Nevertheless, these two sets
              of coordinates are quite comparable.

            <p>
              The comparison between <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> and <em>An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon</em>
              shows that although these texts seem comparable on the map with all the texts, when contrasted one-on-one
              the similarities are not as quick to jump out. Yes, both of these texts spend some time in Africa and start
              in Europe, but this is where the similarities end. Crusoe heads to South America to live out the rest of his
              book, and Robert Knox heads to Ceylon.

               The comparison between <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> and <em>A New Voyage Round the World</em> 
              ultimately tells us more about the latter than it does about <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>. We can 
              trace major developments in <em>A New Voyage Round the World</em>, but the similarities between 
              the two texts are not immediately apparent.

              <em>A Cruising Voyage Round the World</em> has a very similar distribution pattern to 
              <em>A New Voyage Round the World</em>. Unfortunately for <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, the maps
              are not a strong match in terms of similarities.
