              The Mapping Robinson Crusoe Project investigates the iconic 18th-century text 
              <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> and the works that might have inspired it. I compare 
              the locations mentioned in Crusoe with those in potential source texts, and 
              visualize these overlaps and differences through maps.

            <h2>Welcome to the Mapping Robinson Crusoe project</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> has been studied countless times over the last few centuries.
              It is sometimes considered the first novel in the English language, though that claim is 
              contentious. The book was generally well received at the time of its publication, but it 
              also attracted criticism from contemporaries such as Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope.
            </p>
            <p>
              A debate that has risen in <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> studies and 18th century literary studies
              is that of the sources of inspiration for the novel. Though <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> was 
              popular, it did not in fact appear out of thin air. Travel literature and stories of castaways
              could be traced all the way back to the Homeric period with the <em>Odyssey</em>. However, Defoe
              was more likely drawing on some of his contemporaries. Books like <em>The Mighty Kingdom of
              Krinke Kesmes</em> by Hendrik Smeeks and stories like that of Alexander Selkirk have received
              particular attention in scholarship as potential sources of inspiration for Defoe. However, it
              would not be called a debate unless there was some true tension. Scholars such as David Fausett
              are strong supporters of the idea that <em>Crusoe</em> is inspired by travel accounts and travel fiction 
              in the Great Britain, France, and Netherlands tradition (Fausett, 1994); he draws particular focus on 
              Smeeks' book. But scholars like Blaim have serious doubts about this idea (Blaim, 1996). To make things 
              more complicated, we also must consider authorship and attribution in those times. Pauley argues in his 
              2023 paper that questions of authorship and influence in Defoe studies should be treated as matters of 
              probability rather than certainty, and that claims about specific source texts must therefore remain 
              cautious and provisional (Pauley, 2023).
            </p>
            <p>
              While literary evidence and close readings have produced very compelling arguments
              about the origins of <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, this project offers a different approach.
              I focused on patterns rather than "definitive" proofs of inspiration. This project undertakes 
              a comparative study of locations in travel literature published before <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>
              in an attempt to find recurring spatial patterns and possible points of inspiration.
              The primary goal is to compare the movements in these earlier travel accounts to see
              whether there are any striking similarities. I contend that, through digital
              mapping and comparative GIS, new, non-textual evidence can be added to the debate on the
              inspirations of <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>.
