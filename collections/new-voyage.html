              <h2>About this Text</h2>
              <p>
               <em>A New Voyage Round the World</em> by William Dampier is part of the trend of autobiographical travel
                narratives. Dampier moves across the globe, departing from England and making his way down to South
                America. He spends much of his time in this part of the world, visiting places like Panama, Chile, and Mexico.
                He eventually moves on and visits the East Indies and the Philippines. Finally, he ends back in Europe (Dampier, 1697). 
              </p>
              <p>
               Dampier has been called “the most popular and influential travel account of the first half of the 
                eighteenth century” (Thell, 2013, 29). He recounts 12 years of voyages, many of which were spent with 
                his fleet of privateer colleagues, but near the end he branched off and finished on his own. When Dampier 
                is not telling his travel story, he is providing the reader with his observations about the places, plants, 
                animals, and peoples he meets. In current scholarship, there has not been a strong connection made between 
                Robinson Crusoe and A New Voyage Round the World. Some critics, such as Jane H. Jack, note that they are 
                both interesting in different ways (1961), but this does not amount to a substantial comparison between 
                the two texts.

              <p>
               The edition that was used in the mapping process of this project was from A Project Gutenberg of Australia. 
                Although this is by no means the authoritative edition of the novel, I needed a clean txt file in order 
                to perform the computations.
