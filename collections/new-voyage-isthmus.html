              <h2>About this Text</h2>
              <p>
                Lionel Wafer recounts his jounrey in South America and his time with the Cuna people. He is a Welsh sailer and so part
                of his journey was over the ocean. However, the majority of his movements are over land and in Panama, or more specifically
                the Darien region. This text has much more local movements then stretching voyages as seen with some of the other such as
                Robinson Crusoe
              </p>
              <p>
                Much of the plot takes place with the Cuna people as Wafer conducts a sort of pseudo-ethnogrpahic account. He details the region
                to the best of his ability and even provides the reader with a few maps of Derien. Wafer dcuments the geography and environment
                of Isthmus, as well as the cultural practices of the Cuna people who he is stauing with.

               This would have been interesting to map against Robinson Crusoe because of the proximity to Crusoe's fictioinal island. however it could not be accomplished at this moment.
                This is because we could not find a good text that was processed. There exists many scans of the novel but none with OCR. This would be a good addition
                the comparative map.
