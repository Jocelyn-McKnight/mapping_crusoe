              <h2>About this Text</h2>
              <p>
                A Cruising Voyage round the World by Woodes Rogers tells the tale of the author’s adventure in the Atlantic 
                Ocean. The majority of his movements take place in the Caribbean and South America. Rogers and his crew 
                leave from England and head west to Puna and Guayaquil. They see various countries in the South Seas. They 
                go to several popular ports such as Batavia and the Cape of Good Hope, both of which are visited in An 
                Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rogers has many adventures throughout his travels around the world. The taking of Puna and Guayaquil (two 
                important coastal towns) as well as the discovery of Alexander Selkirk are notable events. In the episode 
                of Selkirk’s discovery, readers might remember that his story is widely accepted as one of the inspirations 
                for Robinson Crusoe. In fact, the accessible edition online is a combination of Selkirk’s and Crusoe’s 
                stories (with Selkirk getting the first half of the book and Crusoe the second). So while the plot of this 
                book is quite different from that of Robinson Crusoe in terms of specific locations, they should have some 
                overlap, especially in the South American and Caribbean regions.
              </p>
              <p>
               The edition that was used in the mapping process of this project was from Project Gutenberg. Although this
                is by no means the authoritative edition of the novel, I needed a clean txt file in order to perform the
                computations. This edition was also choose to match Crusoe, as the edition which was mapped was also a Gutenburg.

              Here is the map for A Cruising Voyage round the World. One who is familiar with the text might notice that some of the 
              movements seem inaccurate. They would be correct. The code retreived 286 locations from the text. This
              Is simply not factual. Please read about the trials and tribulations in the <a href="../mapping.html">Mapping section</a>.
