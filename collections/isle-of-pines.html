              <h2>About this Text</h2>
              <p>
                The movements in this text are mostly focused on that of the Dutch sailer arriving at the fictional island
                somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. It is there he finds a colonie of people, all descended from one man who was
                shipwrecked many years ago with four women. The island is populated with the offspring of George Pine. Before
                Pine was shipwrecked, he travelled with his master's household to various places across the Esst Indies. They 
                travelled to places such as St. Hellen's Island, Cape of Good hope, and St. Laurence Island.
              </p>
              <p>
                Isle of Pines is a satirical text and often groupped in with the Robinsonade, even though it predates it by half a
                a century. Most of the plot takes place on the Island between the factions of Pines children and grand children by
                the various women he had been left with.

               This would have been an ideal book to map against Robinson Crusoe, however it could not be accomplished at this moment.
                This is because we could not find a good text that was processed. There exists many scans of the novel but none with OCR.
                There also exists some files of essays about Isle of Pines but not the primary text itself. This would be a good addition
                the mega map.
