              <h2>About this Text</h2>
              <p>
                <em>The Man in the Moone</em> (1638) by Francis Godwin. This is an early science fiction book about a spaniard 
                named Domingo Gonsales. Gonsales flees from spain to the East Indies. He spends much time on the island
                of St. Helena, and then on the moon in a fictional utopian society. When he returns to earth he lands in
                China (Godwin, 1638).
              </p>
              <p>
                This text is often associated with science fiction studies and early space travel more than with the
                traditioinal travel narrarive genre. Scholars are fascinated with the more fantastical elements of the
                story and the association with Kepler, the greatest astronomer of the early modern period (Poole 2005; Poole 2016).
                Nevertheless, scholars have still connected Godwin's text to Defoe. Fancis goes so far as to say that The man in 
                the moon "in part a desert-island story, [and thus] a predecessor of Robinson Crusoe" (Francis, 2021, 98). However,
                I am less concerned about plot element similarities than movement and location similarities.

               The edition that was used in the mapping process of this project was from Project Gutenberg. Although this
                is by no means the authoritative edition of the novel, we needed a clean txt file in order to perform the
                computations.

              Here is the map for The Man in the Moone. One who is familiar with the text might notice that some of the 
              movements seem inaccurate. They would be correct. Please read about the trials and tribulations in the <a href="../mapping.html">Mapping section</a>.
