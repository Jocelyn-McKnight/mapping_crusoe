              <h2>About this Text</h2>
              <p>
               <em>An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylo</em>n by Robert Knox, written in 1681, is an autobiographical tale of
                Robert Knox’s time in Sri Lanka, which was known at the time as the Island of Ceylon. Although much of this
                book takes place while the author is captive, there are still significant movements. The movements are
                more condensed to the island. Nevertheless, there is the initial voyage across the ocean, and then the group is
                pushed onto the east coast of Ceylon. Then there are various movements across the island until he escapes and returns
                to London (Knox, 1681).
              </p>
              <p>
                There are some general plot points which are similar to Robinson Crusoe. For example, the idea of being held
                priosoner on a foreign island is similar to Crusoe being stranded on a foreign island. However, as I have
                said before, I am less interested in the literary similarities between Crusoe and the potential sources. 
              </p>

               The edition that was used in the mapping process of this project was from Project Gutenberg. Although this
                is by no means the authoritative edition of the text, we needed a clean txt file in order to perform the
                computations. Other digital versions exist, in fact a pdf availble on google scholar was almost used, yet
                we decided to go with the Gutenburg for consistency with the Crusoe (which is also a Gutenburg).

              Here is the map for <em>An Historical Relation Of The Island Ceylon</em>. One who is familiar with 
              the text might notice that some of the movements seem inaccurate. They would be correct. This text brough out an
               exceptionally high amount of noise. In fact, there are over 1000 alledged data point, and more than 4 times the
              the amount of location in Robinson Crusoe. Please read about the trials and tribulations in the <a href="../mapping.html">Mapping section</a>.
