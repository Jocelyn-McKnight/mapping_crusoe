            <p>
            The Mapping Robinson Crusoe Project was created for the final project of the 
            English 4400: Violent Voyages course at the University of Lethbridge Fall 2025.
            The Creator, Jocelyn McKnight, Came to the idea when thinking about movement in 
            <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> and other GIS/Digital Mapping projects. Particularly, the Diogenet 
            project, which mapped out the movements of Greek philosophers, played a big inspiration.
            Unfortunately, this project is no longer active but it used to be found at https://diogenet.ucsd.edu/map/.
            Originally, the idea behind the Crusoe project was to replicate the the Diogenet Project 
            but here we were looking for the relationship between fictional and factual text. The project evolved
            from the original idea, as fortunately, there is a debate in Crusoe studies on the texts that could have
            inspired Robinson Crusoe. The mapping project was the perfect way to get involved in the
            debate and use computational tools to provide more evidence.

            PhD student and GIS expert, Davide Pafumi provided invaulable guidence on how to set up 
            the mapping codes. He explained what data I needed and which libraries should be used in a 
            project like this. Luckily for me, he already had part of the code done from a different project
            and I just had to adapt it.

            Prof. Dana Lew provided the intial list of Crusoe sources. Those were invaluable. I am so sorry
            you had to see your books defiled on the map.

            The design of the website is heavily inspired by the Franz Hals Museum in Haarlem (Netherlands). I truely
            believe they have one of the best websites ever, especially for digital exhibitions. Check it out if you get
            the chance https://franshalsmuseum.nl/en/about-us! ChatGPT 5.1 provided valuable HTML support and help clean
            up my style sheet and integrate some features that I was really set on having, such as the rounded corners on 
            the images and the navigation bar (which is my weakest coding skills btw). ALso thank you to everyone on reddit
            who has ever posted about css for html.
